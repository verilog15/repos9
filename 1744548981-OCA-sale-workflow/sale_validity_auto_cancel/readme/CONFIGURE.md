1. Go to the menu *Sales \> Configuration \> Settings*.

2. In the *Quotations & Sales* section, set the *Auto-cancel expired quotations after X days* parameter to define how many days after the expiration date the quotations will be canceled automatically.

3. Additionally, open the contact form for any customer and under the *Sales&Purchase* tab, you will see the checkbox *Auto-cancel Quotations*. This checkbox is checked by default, meaning the system will automatically cancel expired quotations for this contact. You can uncheck it if you do not want the scheduled action to cancel quotations for that specific contact.
