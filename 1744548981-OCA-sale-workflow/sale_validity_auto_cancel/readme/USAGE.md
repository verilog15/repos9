  - By default, the scheduled action "Cancel Expired Quotations" is not enabled to allow initial configuration of the auto-cancel period in days.

  - Once enabled, the scheduled action will run automatically once a day, canceling expired quotations based on the defined expiration period.

  - For each contact, the Auto-cancel Quotations checkbox under the Sales&Purchase tab controls whether that contactâ€™s quotations will be       auto-canceled. If checked, the quotations will be canceled after expiration. If unchecked, the scheduled action will skip those quotations.
