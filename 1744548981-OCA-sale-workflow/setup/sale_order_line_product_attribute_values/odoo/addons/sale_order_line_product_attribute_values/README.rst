Use Cases / Context
===================

This module was developed because there is no way to know what Product
Attribute Values has been used on a product if there is only one
attribute configured in the product with "Never create variants" mode.

It will be useful for you if you want to know which Product Attribute
Values has been used in which Sale Order Lines.

If you need this module for those reasons, these might interest you too:

- sale_order_line_menu

Configuration
=============

This module will not trigger the recomputation of the lines attributes
when installing only this module. This will avoid the installation
timeout.

If you later want to recompute the lines, you can use a scheduled action
similar to this one:

.. code:: python

   env["sale.order.line"].search([
     ("product_template_id.attribute_line_ids", "!=", []),
   ])._compute_all_product_template_attribute_value_ids()

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Create an Attribute called "Trademark" (for example) with Display
   Type "Pills", Variants Creation Mode "Never" and add an Attribute
   Value called "Adidas"
2. Create a product called "Shoe Adidas REF 123" and "Show Adidas REF
   456"
3. Add "Trademark: Adidas" on Attributes & Variants tab on both products
   and configure (you can set an incremented price if you want)
4. Sell both products in a Sale Order
5. Created Sale Order Lines has Product Template Attribute Values and
   Attribute Values its lines.
6. If you has installed ``sale_order_line_menu``, you can check those
   values on Sale > Orders > Order Lines.
