This module adds a scheduled action that automatically cancels
quotations after their expiration date.

Added starting from v16: A checkbox has been added in the contact form
under the Sales&Purchase tab. This checkbox is selected by default and
controls whether quotations related to that contact will be
automatically canceled. If unchecked, the scheduled action will not
cancel quotations for that specific contact, allowing more control over
the auto-cancellation process on a per-contact basis.

A company setting can be modified to decide how many days after the
expiration date the quotations are automatically cancelled.

Configuration
=============

1. Go to the menu *Sales > Configuration > Settings*.

2. In the *Quotations & Sales* section, set the *Auto-cancel expired
   quotations after X days* parameter to define how many days after the
   expiration date the quotations will be canceled automatically.

3. Additionally, open the contact form for any customer and under the
   *Sales&Purchase* tab, you will see the checkbox *Auto-cancel
   Quotations*. This checkbox is checked by default, meaning the system
   will automatically cancel expired quotations for this contact. You
   can uncheck it if you do not want the scheduled action to cancel
   quotations for that specific contact.

Usage
=====

-  By default, the scheduled action "Cancel Expired Quotations" is not
   enabled to allow initial configuration of the auto-cancel period in
   days.

-  Once enabled, the scheduled action will run automatically once a day,
   canceling expired quotations based on the defined expiration period.

-  For each contact, the Auto-cancel Quotations checkbox under the
   Sales&Purchase tab controls whether that contactâ€™s quotations will be
   auto-canceled. If checked, the quotations will be canceled after
   expiration. If unchecked, the scheduled action will skip those
   quotations.
