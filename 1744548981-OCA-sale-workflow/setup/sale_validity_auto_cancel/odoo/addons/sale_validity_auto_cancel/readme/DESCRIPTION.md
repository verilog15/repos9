This module adds a scheduled action that automatically cancels
quotations after their expiration date.

Added starting from v16: A checkbox has been added in the contact form under the Sales&Purchase tab. This checkbox is selected by default and controls whether quotations related to that contact will be automatically canceled. If unchecked, the scheduled action will not cancel quotations for that specific contact, allowing more control over the auto-cancellation process on a per-contact basis.

A company setting can be modified to decide how many days after the
expiration date the quotations are automatically cancelled.
