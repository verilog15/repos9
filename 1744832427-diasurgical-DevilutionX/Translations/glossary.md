# Translations glossary

## Variables

There are two types of variables in the text files: `%s`, `%i`. All of these will add something within the single string, here are some examples.

`%s` will always be another word. Example: `%s of %s` refers to an created Item which includes affixes. `Tin Cap of the Fool` would be such an item.
`%i` will always be a number. Example: `Fire hit damage: %i-%i` will indicate how much fire damage a weapon will deal.

**IMPORTANT**: You have to keep those intact and in the same order.

### Example

Working:

	`%s' (level %i) just joined the game`
changed to
	`%s' (level %i) is now with you.`

Not working:

	`%s' (level %i) just joined the game`
changed to
	`A level %i Character named % s' is now with you.`

## %s of %s

The rather tricky line `%s of %s` is used to create items with pre- and suffixes as mentioned in examples above. If your language has gendered articles it might be advisable to remove the "of" but add a gendered article to each suffix instead. If you do so the line should be changed to `%s %s` and you will have to add the appropriate article to each suffix.

## Adding lines

Unfortunately it is not possible to add new lines for languages outside of quest texts.

## Names

Please try to keep original names intact, however it's up to your judgment to change something that sounds completely wrong in the language you are translating to.

## Coherence

Make sure that you use the same terminology where it's applicable. 

Example:

Good:
	`fully recover life`
	`recover life`
	`fully recover mana`
	`recover mana`

Bad:
	`recover all life points`
	`recover partial life`
	`fully recover mana`
	`recover mana`
