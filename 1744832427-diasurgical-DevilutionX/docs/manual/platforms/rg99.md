# DevilutionX (Diablo 1) for RG99

## Installation

**This version is experimental and requires using an unsupported fork of OpenDingux!**

1. Install the OpenDingux fork from https://github.com/od-contrib/buildroot/releases
2. Copy [devilutionx-rg99.opk](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/releases/latest/download/devilutionx-rg99.opk) to the apps directory.
3. Unpack and minify all the MPQ contents using `unpack_and_minify` from https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionx-mpq-tools/.
4. Copy the resulting directories to:

   ~~~
   /media/data/local/home/.local/share/diasurgical/devilution/
