# Contribution guidelines
Before you create a pull request, please review the following guidelines for your contribution. Thank you in advance.

## Your files use tab indendation (keep tabs) of size 4
In our project, we use tab indentation with a size of 4. Please have your settings abide this rule.

**Note**: Most editors support our provided [.editorconfig](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/blob/master/.editorconfig) file, but certain functionalities (for example ones provided by plugins or addons) sometimes do not abide it. Please be careful and considerate with your actions!

For Visual Studio:

	Tools -> Options
	Text Editor -> C# -> Tabs
	Settings:
		Indenting: Smart
		Tab size: 4
		Indent size: 4
		Keep tabs CHECKED

For Notepad++:

	Tools -> Preferences
	Language -> C#
	Settings:
		[Default]
		Tab size: 4
		Replace by space UNCHECKED

If you use another editor, please find these settings yourself and adjust them accordingly.

## You edit in the tModLoader solution
The chance is very slim that you need either of the other workspaces. If you did use them, **please be absolutely sure that you had to work in them**. If you are unsure, feel free to ask us before proposing your contribution.

To open this workspace, navigate to solutions/ and open tModLoader.sln

## You use our code patcher, so you only commit patches
In this project we work with our own code patcher. This is so that we do not publish the entire Terraria codebase (which isn't allowed), but we can still open-source our code.

To open our code patcher, run setup.bat from the main directory.
If you've worked in the tModLoader workspace, you press 'Diff tModLoader'
This will create new patches containing your changes in the patches/ folder

**You can still commit other files if needed for example if you updated translations or sprites, but in general you should only commit patches.**

## You inspect your diffs (patches)
Before you propose your contribution, inspect your patches. Please make sure that file formatting didn't mess up (this can happen with certain plugins and addons!)

![Diff example](https://i.imgur.com/jwu2GOG.png "Diff example")

**Make sure your patch is as small as possible, so try to introduce as little changes as possible.** Sometimes this may require some additional thoughts about changes you make, and you may prefer a different approach to ensure a small patch difference.

For formatting it can help if your formatting tool supports our .editorconfig file. Ensure you have the same indentation levels, braces on the same line etc.

## Helpful tips for contributions
Because tModLoader is a big project, we want to make sure contributions don't introduce unnecessary code or code that is fundamentally flawed by design. But please don't be discouraged! If you are unsure about your contribution, still feel free to propose it and in your proposal ask us for feedback. If you do, please add "WIP:" in the title of your proposal. It is also helpful if you are specific about what you want feedback on. We will always try to provide you feedback in a passive and helpful manner.
