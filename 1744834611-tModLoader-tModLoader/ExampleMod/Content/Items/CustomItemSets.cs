	// This class demonstrates "custom ID sets". "Custom ID sets" are arrays indexed by content ids such as those seen in all the ID classes (ItemID.Sets, NPCID.Sets, ProjectileID.Sets, etc). This allows mods to easily implement content id-specific data.
	// These custom ID sets are registered with a key, giving them a public identity and making them "named ID sets".
	// "Named ID sets" are automatically merged when other mods declare the same ID set, facilitating "ad-hoc" collaboration that doesn't require mod dependencies.
	// See https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/pull/4381 for more information about custom and named ID sets.

	// This [ReinitializeDuringResizeArrays] attribute will cause this class's static constructor to be called during the ResizeArrays step of mod loading. This is essential for any class with field initializers calling SetFactory methods.
	// This will allow the arrays to have the correct lengths after all content has been loaded into the game. This reinitialization happens before ModSystem.ResizeArrays, avoiding potential issues from mod load order.

		// This is then optionally followed by the Decription method. The description explains how this mod uses the set. Other mods can view this description using the /customsets chat command.
		// Finally the RegisterXSet method is called to register the set.
		// We can pass in any initial data to the RegisterXSet method, in this case we are indicating that FieryGreatsword and ExampleSword should be true in this set. Note that it is also possible to set these set values in SetStaticDefaults instead, which is more typical. See ExampleFlail.cs for an example.
		// By registering the set, other mods can access it the key. The key and default value must be consistent with other mods. Remember that the Mod name is part of the key that that other mods will be using to access this set.

Without ReinitializeDuringResizeArrays the code may incorrectly use 0 as the value of ModContent.ItemType<ExampleSword>() because modded IDs may not have been assigned yet when the class is first initialized.
