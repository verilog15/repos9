//Things that need to be done after initial patches are fixed.
//This can include new systems that should be accounted for

//Rartrin
	//Chat
		//Mod commands should make use of new vanilla command system.
		//This includes moving the say command
	//Wing
		//Loading should leverage player.GetWingStats()
		//ArmorIDs.Wing.Sets.Stats
	//Background system
		//Main.bgAlpha2 became Main.bgAlphaFrontLayer
		//Background system in general got some refactoring
	//Minimum zoom comparer
		//Check if ModLoader.ModLoader.removeForcedMinimumZoom is still needed now that MinimumZoomComparerX and Y exist
	//WaterStyleLoader.ChooseWaterStyle
		//Vanilla has Main.CalculateWaterStyle() now
	//Integrate with vanilla asset system
		//?Reimplement PlayerHooks.GetMapBackgroundImage in DrawMapFullscreenBackground so it can use assets
	//SceneMetrics
		//This includes tile counts and banner buffs.
		//Moved from player to Main.ScreneMetrics
	//TileEntity
		//We should easily be able to remove all patches to the TileEntity class by doing the following:
			//Make ModTileEntity use new abstracted vanilla TileEntityManager.
			//Always use "is" check on TileEntity rather than id>= to determine a ModTileEntity.
	//GameContent.ItemShopSellbackHelper
		//Worth keeping track of item data?
